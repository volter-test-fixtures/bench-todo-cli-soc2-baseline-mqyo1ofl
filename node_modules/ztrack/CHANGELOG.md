# Changelog

All notable ztrack release changes are recorded here.

## 0.34.1

Reliability fixes for the visualizer and GitHub sync.

- **Visualizer no longer leaks immortal server processes.** The `ztrack visualizer` wrapper now kills its
  Bun server child on its own exit/SIGINT/SIGTERM/SIGHUP, and the server self-reaps when it sees its parent
  gone (it polls the wrapper pid passed via `ZTRACK_VIZ_PARENT_PID`, immune to bun cold-start reparenting).
  Previously a programmatic/agent teardown that SIGKILLed the wrapper orphaned the server to PID 1 forever;
  they accumulated across a busy fleet.
- **GitHub sync no longer crashes on a stale binding.** `pull` and `reconcileSync` now skip a bound issue
  whose local ztrack issue was deleted (the `issue view` returns null) instead of throwing.

## 0.34.0

Shared cross-worktree board (now the default) + a loop-gate scoping fix.

- **Shared local board across worktrees, now the DEFAULT.** A local tracker is no longer
  branch-scoped: issues are visible and globally-numbered across every git worktree of a repo via
  a central symlink index under the common git dir, regenerable from the committed markdown
  (fresh-clone safe). This lets a substrate-agnostic coordinator (e.g. a PM dispatching one
  worktree per issue) read every issue's live state without a remote tracker. Opt back into the
  old per-branch behavior with `ztrack init --branch`. **Breaking:** new local inits default to
  the shared board.
- **Fixed the `ztrack loop` Stop-hook gate scoping.** `stop-loop.sh` parsed a flat `"issue"`
  field the loop marker no longer writes, so the gate fell back to validating the whole tracker —
  on a multi-issue board it held the agent's turn on *any* red issue, not the armed one. It now
  reads the marker's canonical `target.ids[0]`; bare/auto/file targets stay unscoped so
  `check --auto-scope` resolves from the branch.

## 0.33.1

Documentation only — no code or behavior change (refreshes the npm package page).

- **Reframed the docs around the two usage patterns.** The README is now a two-step front door —
  **Setup** (install, local-vs-linked, preset, the loop gate) then **Usage**, presenting `ztrack
  check` (verify on demand — CI, pre-merge) and `ztrack loop` (the ralph loop — *recommended for
  development*) as two co-equal patterns over the same targets. The Guide mirrors the spine and the
  agent playbook leads with driving work under the loop.
- **Consolidated doc sprawl.** Merged `PRESET-GUIDE.md` into `docs/PRESETS.md`, folded
  `docs/WORLD-INTEGRATION.md` into `docs/EVIDENCE.md`, and removed a shipped design note and the
  redundant docs index — the learn path is now README → Guide → Presets → Evidence → API/Architecture.
- **Accuracy fixes verified against the live CLI:** completed the `simple-sdlc` rule-code list,
  documented `evidence_commit_unrelated` (opt-in `paths:` relevance), corrected `ztrack waiver
  status|clear <issue>` to show the required issue arg, added `--assignee` to `issue create|edit`
  help, fixed stale preset names in `ARCHITECTURE.md`, and signposted that there is no programmatic
  loop primitive (be the loop yourself via `checkTracker`).

## 0.33.0

Internal refactor sweep from the OSS-posture review — code organization and naming, no behavior
change. Five structural cleanups, each behavior-preserving and guard-backed:

- **Naming: markdown models out of the `presets` namespace.** `src/presets.ts` → `src/rawIssueMarkdown.ts`
  (the raw structured model: `parseRawIssueMarkdown`/`renderPresetCanonicalIssueMarkdown`),
  `src/presets/issueMarkdown.ts` → `src/markdownDocument.ts` (the lenient mdast read-model). The
  one-line `markdownModel.ts` alias is gone. They are document grammars, not presets — the old names
  conflated them with the validation presets.
- **Command-surface guard.** `docsConsistency` now fails CI if docs reference a `ztrack <command>`
  that no longer exists in the dispatch (the check that would have caught the phantom
  `snapshot project-manager`), and the linked-sync deep-dive moved from the README to `docs/GUIDE.md`.
- **Shared SDLC-grammar conformance kit.** `src/testkit/presetConformance.ts` exports
  `assertSdlcGrammarConformance(...)`; `simple-sdlc` and `simple-gh-sdlc` both call it instead of
  duplicating the relevance-gap / passed-AC / anti-tamper blocks. Preset-specific PR tests stay
  inline. Zero coverage lost (50/52 preset tests still pass).
- **Preset catalog split out of `config.ts`.** Manifest discovery + resolve + install + 3-way
  upgrade + `initTrackerProject` now live in `src/presetCatalog.ts` (a one-way dependency on
  `config.ts`); `config.ts` is back to path/config primitives (367 → 180 lines).
- **`cli.ts` decomposed (674 → 447 lines).** `init`, `loop`, and `waiver` extracted into
  `cliInit.ts`/`cliLoop.ts`/`cliWaiver.ts` as `handleXCommand(args): Promise<boolean>` handlers,
  matching the existing check/evidence/completions split.

## 0.32.1

Doc-truth fixes from an OSS-posture review (4 reviewers: adopter, contributor, two architects), plus
closing a hole in the drift guard that let them through.

- **Closed the `docsConsistency` guard's blind spots.** It now expands brace-lists
  (`boilerplates/presets/{a,b,c}.ts`) before checking existence, and validates every backtick-cited
  `src/**/*.ts` path — the exact gaps that let `ARCHITECTURE.md`/`TESTING.md` cite renamed files.
- **Fixed `ARCHITECTURE.md` drift** the guard now catches: the reference presets are
  `simple-sdlc`/`simple-gh-sdlc`/`spec`/`speckit` (not the renamed `default.ts`); `mutate.ts` →
  `modelEdit.ts`; `createTrackerClient` is markdown-only (the `local` backend is removed); and
  removed the phantom `ztrack snapshot project-manager` command (it doesn't exist).
- **Fixed `TESTING.md`** stale test-file references (`mutate.test.ts` → `modelEdit.test.ts`,
  `presetKit.test.ts` → `presets/issueMarkdown.test.ts`, `presetInstall.test.ts` →
  `presetUpgrade.test.ts`, preset names).
- **`CONTRIBUTING.md`**: added the required `bun run build` before `bun test` — the e2e suite
  resolves `ztrack/preset-kit` from `dist/`, so a fresh-clone `bun test` failed without it (the #1
  contributor bounce).
- **README**: added a "Stability & dependencies" note — pin a version pre-1.0; the local core is
  dependency-light, GitHub sync / world evidence route through `@volter-ai-dev/twin`.

## 0.32.0

Docs consolidation — one home per topic, plus a guard so they can't silently drift again.

- **Merged `docs/ADOPTING.md` + `docs/EXAMPLES.md` + `docs/COOKBOOKS.md` into one
  [`docs/GUIDE.md`](docs/GUIDE.md)** — a task-oriented guide (adopt → local check → CI gate → agent
  enforcement → visualize), one recipe per task, no duplication. The three docs taught the same
  flows three times, which is how preset names and recipes kept drifting out of sync.
- **Trimmed the README** to a front door: it keeps the quickstart, the honesty box, and the preset
  table, and now *links* to the Guide for the deep how-to (agent setup, CI) instead of duplicating
  it. The agent Stop-hook setup detail now lives once, in the Guide.
- **New doc-drift guard** (`src/docsConsistency.test.ts`, CI-only) fails the build if any doc has a
  broken relative link, cites a `boilerplates/presets/<name>.ts` that doesn't exist, or names a
  `--preset` that isn't a real preset/alias — the exact drift classes (renamed `default.ts`, deleted
  pages, stale preset names) that required repeated manual sweeps.
- Each fact now has a single source of truth: preset choice → `PRESETS.md` + `ztrack init --list`,
  evidence → `EVIDENCE.md`, programmatic use → `API.md`, the how-to flows → `GUIDE.md`. No
  user-facing behavior change.

## 0.31.1

Doc consistency + small UX fixes (from a second 6-persona new-user review of the published package).

- **Preset naming made consistent.** After the `default→simple-sdlc/simple-gh-sdlc` split, the docs
  mixed `default` (the alias) and `simple-sdlc` (the real name): the README "Install presets" table
  still listed `default` and omitted `simple-gh-sdlc` while the quickstart used `simple-sdlc`. The
  README table now lists all four presets (marking `simple-sdlc` recommended + `default` its alias)
  and points to `ztrack init --list`; README/ADOPTING/EXAMPLES/EVIDENCE/PRESETS prose now name the
  preset `simple-sdlc` consistently. `--preset default` still works everywhere (it's the alias).
- **Fixed dead `boilerplates/presets/default.ts` path references** (renamed to `simple-sdlc.ts`) in
  `PRESET-GUIDE.md` and `docs/PRESETS.md` — a contributor told to "copy the bar" hit a 404.
- `ztrack init` now **echoes the installed preset** (`Initialized ztrack team … • preset <name>`).
- `docs/ADOPTING.md` now surfaces `simple-gh-sdlc` for GitHub PR teams and routes through `ztrack
  init --list` instead of an outdated `default|spec|speckit` list.
- Documented the loose-file caveat (a `check ./file.md` runs structure+evidence but treats status as
  draft — lifecycle gates need a stored issue), fixed the `PR:` grammar example to a real PR URL
  (the merged-PR gate keys on the URL), and added a copy-paste `Stop`-hook `settings.json` snippet
  for non-plugin agent harnesses.

## 0.31.0

Manifest-driven preset discovery — so the preset catalog scales without a hand-maintained list.

- Presets are now **discovered by scanning** `boilerplates/presets/`. Each preset is two
  co-located files: `<name>.ts` (the standalone preset) + a new **`<name>.json`** manifest sidecar
  (`{ description, aliases?, recommended? }`). Adding a preset = drop those two files; nothing else
  to register.
- New **`ztrack init --list`** prints the catalog with each preset's description, the recommended
  baseline, and its aliases — generated from the sidecars, never hardcoded.
- Removed every hardcoded preset list: the `CanonicalTrackerPreset` union and `INIT_TRACKER_PRESETS`
  array in `config.ts`, the visualizer's static `STANDALONE_PRESETS` map (it now resolves
  `--preset <name>` via the manifest + a dynamic import), and the enumerated `--preset a|b|c` in CLI
  help/errors (now `--preset <name>` + a pointer to `--list`). An unknown `--preset` points to
  `--list`. `default` remains an alias for the recommended `simple-sdlc`.
- A guard test (`boilerplates/presets/presetManifest.test.ts`) fails CI if a preset lacks its
  sidecar, if there isn't exactly one `recommended`, if aliases collide, or if a preset's exported
  `name` doesn't match its filename — the class of drift that broke the visualizer in 0.30.0.
- Documented the workflow in `boilerplates/README.md` and `PRESET-GUIDE.md` (§4 build order + a "no
  central preset list" entry in the Never list).

## 0.30.1

Ships the 0.30.0 preset split (0.30.0's publish was blocked by a build break). Fix: the visualizer
(`visualizer/serverCore.ts`) and CLI help now reference the renamed presets (`simple-sdlc` /
`simple-gh-sdlc`) instead of the removed `default.ts`.

## 0.30.0

Split the dev-lifecycle preset along the one axis that varies — the acceptance proof — and make
the lean, PR-free process the baseline.

- **`simple-sdlc`** (new): the dev SDLC without the PR coupling. `done` = every AC
  passed-with-evidence (commit + proof; image optional) — no pull request, so it runs on a private
  repo with **no remote**. Keeps the full evidence integrity, relevance, and the opt-in dependency
  (block) graph. Drops `review_requires_pr` / `done_requires_merged_pr` / `evidence_sha_stale` /
  `current_head_unknown` and the `pr` field.
- **`simple-gh-sdlc`** (was `default`): the PR-based process (review on a PR, merged PR for `done`),
  renamed. The seed for richer GitHub validation (world annotations + sources) to come.
- **`default` is now an alias for `simple-sdlc`.** `ztrack init` (no flag) and `--preset default`
  install the lean preset; a repo previously recorded as `default` upgrades against `simple-gh-sdlc`
  so its PR process is preserved.

## 0.29.0

Make the `@volter-ai-dev/twin` dependency honest — it's a real, bundled dependency, not an
"optional peer."

- `@volter-ai-dev/twin` + `@volter-ai-dev/twin-github` are now regular **dependencies** (were
  declared as *optional peer* dependencies). They power `ztrack sync github` and world-backed
  validation, and were already being bundled into the CLI — so the "optional" declaration was a
  fiction left over from when twin was a private `@volter/twin` GitHub-Packages package. It's now
  public on npm, so it's a normal dependency.
- This **fixes** the `ztrack/world-annotations` and `ztrack/world-source-books` subpaths, which
  previously failed with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` in a plain install (they import twin at runtime, and
  nothing guaranteed it was installed). They now resolve in any install.
- Removed a no-op `--external=@volter/twin` build flag (wrong scope name — it never matched the real
  `@volter-ai-dev/twin`, so twin was silently bundled anyway). The bundling is now intentional:
  `ztrack sync github` works from a plain `npm i ztrack` with no extra install step.
- Docs reconciled: `WORLD-INTEGRATION.md` and `ARCHITECTURE.md` described twin as a private
  GitHub-Packages optional peer requiring registry setup — all stale. Now: a public-npm regular
  dependency; world integration is opt-in by *policy* (your preset), not by installing anything.

## 0.28.0

Trim the published API surface to what's actually used.

- The `exports` map shipped **16 subpaths**, but ten of them (`ztrack/mcp`, `ztrack/lint`,
  `ztrack/tx`, `ztrack/attest`, `ztrack/dsse`, `ztrack/export`, `ztrack/config`,
  `ztrack/markdown-model`, `ztrack/ac-version`, `ztrack/presets`) were **internal CLI-command
  modules with no consumer** — nothing imported them, and their useful symbols are already
  re-exported from the package root. They are no longer published entry points (the modules remain
  internal; the bundled CLI is unaffected).
- **Supported surface is now**: `ztrack` (the root — the curated public API), `ztrack/preset-kit`
  (preset authoring), `ztrack/check` + `ztrack/sdk` (narrow imports the SDK demo uses), and
  `ztrack/world-annotations` + `ztrack/world-source-books` (the documented world-integration
  extension). See [docs/API.md](docs/API.md).
- Potentially breaking only if you imported one of the removed subpaths directly; switch to the
  package root (`import { … } from 'ztrack'`), which exposes the same functions. The CI export-smoke
  guard now enforces this minimal surface (and fails if a speculative subpath is re-added).

## 0.27.0

Documentation + discoverability pass (from a 6-persona new-user review) plus two small fixes. No
breaking changes.

- **Docs — new pages:** [`docs/EVIDENCE.md`](docs/EVIDENCE.md) (cite/store/verify evidence, commit
  vs attach, in-toto + DSSE signing — the evidence surface was previously CLI/`--help`-only) and
  [`docs/API.md`](docs/API.md) (run a check from code with `checkTracker`, issue CRUD with
  `createTrackerClient`, and the full exports map). Both linked from the README and docs index.
- **Docs — fixes:** the `docs/PRESETS.md` worked preset example was stale (old
  `parse(markdown)`/`serialize(root): string` signatures) — rewritten to the real
  `parse(records: IssueRecord[])` / `serialize(issue) => { body, columns }` contract, plus an "add
  one rule" recipe and a `ztrack preset upgrade` (3-way merge) section. Documented `--phase
  all|gate` and a **GitHub-linked CI gate** recipe in `docs/EXAMPLES.md`, plus the seven MCP
  `tracker_*` tools. Reconciled the storage design doc (Phase 3 shipped in 0.23–0.24, not "next").
- **Packaging:** `demos/` (incl. the SDK example) and `plugins/` (the `ztrack-gate` loop Stop hook)
  now ship in the npm package, so the README's hook reference and the SDK demo are reachable from an
  install. README hook path corrected (`plugins/ztrack-gate/hooks/stop-loop.sh`) and the two hooks
  (always-on `stop-check` vs armed-loop `stop-loop`) disambiguated.
- **Fix:** `ztrack ac/issue patch <unknown-id>` now fails with a clean `issue <id> not found`
  instead of leaking `Cannot read properties of null (reading 'assignee')`.
- **Fix:** `ztrack evidence export --format in-toto --sign` (a bare `--sign`) is now rejected with a
  hint to use `--sign-key <private.pem>`, instead of silently emitting an *unsigned* statement that
  could read as attested. Real DSSE signing via `--sign-key` is unchanged.

## 0.26.1

Security fix — a fabricated screenshot could pass the gate when the evidence fields were written in
a documented order.

- The default preset parsed an evidence line with an **order-sensitive** regex (`image=` had to
  precede `commit=`). The docs and `issue scaffold` show `commit=<sha> acv=1 image=<file>` (image
  **last**) — in that order the `image=` field was silently dropped, so the cited screenshot was
  never resolved or verified and a **fabricated image path passed `check` (exit 0)**. This
  contradicted the core "a fabricated screenshot fails" guarantee.
- Fix: evidence fields now parse in **any order** (`parseEvidenceLine` tokenizes `key=value`), in
  lockstep with the offline file-resolution scan. A cited `image=` is always captured and therefore
  always verified at its commit (`evidence_file_not_found`), regardless of field order. Regression
  tests added (fabricated image written after `commit` → caught; real image in that order → passes).
  Only the `default` preset was affected.

## 0.26.0

Relevance **enforcement** — make the opt-in `paths` anchor mandatory so every passed AC is checked.

- New **`config.relevance`** dial (default **`optional`**, fully non-breaking). Set it to
  **`required`** and the new **`passed_ac_missing_paths`** rule fails any passed AC that declares no
  `paths:` — turning 0.25.0's opt-in relevance check into full coverage: every passed AC's commit
  must now be anchored to (and verified against) the repo paths it claims to touch.
- The default preset's `loadContext` resolves the dial from disk (`relevanceMode`, re-exported on
  `ztrack/preset-kit`) and surfaces it on the validation context (`context.relevance`); the rule is
  pure and offline. Repos that don't set `relevance` see no change.
- The finding is self-documenting: it points you to declare the AC's `paths` (after which its cited
  commit must change one of them, via `evidence_commit_unrelated`).

## 0.25.0

Relevance check — a passed AC's cited commit must actually touch the work it claims.

- The default preset's AC now accepts an optional **`paths:`** line (comma/space-separated globs:
  `*` within a path segment, `**` across segments, else exact/dir-prefix). When a passed AC declares
  `paths`, its cited commit(s) must change at least one matching file, or the new
  **`evidence_commit_unrelated`** rule fails it — a deterministic, offline partial close of the
  relevance gap (an unrelated real commit that compiles + exists no longer satisfies the AC). It is
  strictly **opt-in**: an AC with no `paths` is unaffected, and the rule never fires when the cited
  commit's file list can't be resolved (a missing commit is reported once, by
  `evidence_commit_not_found`).
- `loadContext` resolves each cited commit's changed files offline via `git show --name-only`
  (exposed as `gitCommitFiles` on `ztrack/preset-kit`); the gate makes no network call.
- The finding is self-documenting: it points you to cite the commit that really changed the declared
  paths, or to correct the `paths:` line.

## 0.24.0

GitHub attachment evidence — store evidence on the linked repo instead of committing it.

- **`ztrack evidence add <file> --attach`** uploads the file to the linked GitHub repo as a release
  asset (the `ztrack-evidence` release) and prints `image=<url> sha256=<digest>` to cite. Auth is
  the gh CLI.
- The default preset's evidence now accepts a **URL `image=` pinned by `sha256=`**. `check` accepts
  it **offline** — the digest is a tamper-evident commitment, so the gate never makes a network
  call. (A repo-path image is still verified at its commit; a `sha256:` blob ref is untouched.)
- **`ztrack evidence verify [--issues a,b]`** is the network step the gate skips: it fetches every
  URL-pinned evidence and checks the bytes match the pinned digest — a swapped or rotted asset
  fails loudly. Private repos are fetched via the gh CLI; public over plain HTTP. Live-verified
  end-to-end against throwaway public and private repos (attach → check → verify, plus a tamper
  case that fails).
- `evidence.store` stays `commit` by default (offline, commit-verified, code-adjacent — the
  strongest model); `attach` is opt-in via the config or `--attach`.

(Linear/Jira attachment upload is not built — it needs accounts to develop and live-test against.)

## 0.23.0

Completes the evidence storage UX (the commit-based path; provider attachment upload is next).

- **`ztrack evidence add <file> [--name]`** copies a screenshot/artifact into the evidence dir
  (default `.volter/evidence`, committed), stamps its sha256, and prints the path to cite
  (`image=<path>`). Commit it → the `evidence_file_not_found` rule (0.22.0) verifies it exists at
  the cited commit. So the loop is: capture → `evidence add` → cite → commit → verified. `--blob`
  keeps the content-addressed form.
- **`config.evidence`** = `{ store?: "auto"|"commit"|"attach"|"external", dir? }`. `auto` resolves
  to `commit` today (committed evidence verifies at the cited commit, in both local and linked
  trackers); it will resolve to `attach` for linked trackers once provider upload lands.

## 0.22.0

Evidence is now real, and linked trackers work across git worktrees. **Breaking** (the evidence
grammar changed; see below).

- **Evidence is `commit + proof` at its core; the image is optional and verified when present.**
  Before, a passed AC required an `image=` token that was never checked — so `image=health.png`
  (a label pointing at nothing) passed. Now:
  - `image` is **optional** — author evidence as `evidence ev1: commit=<sha> acv=1` + a `proof`.
  - If you *do* cite an image as a repo path, a new rule **`evidence_file_not_found`** verifies it
    is actually committed at that commit (`git cat-file -e <sha>:<path>`, checkout-independent). A
    fabricated screenshot path now fails the gate. `--no-verify-commits` skips it (shallow/CI), and
    `sha256:` blob refs are left to the blob store.
  - **Breaking:** existing evidence citing a non-committed `image=` label will now fail — drop the
    image (keep commit+proof) or commit the file. Examples/docs updated accordingly.
- **Linked tracker cache is shared per-clone, not per-worktree.** The issue markdown cache + sync
  bookkeeping (reconcile base, identity bindings, conflicts) now resolve to
  `<git-common-dir>/ztrack/…` — one cache shared by every worktree of a clone, never committed or
  pushed (it's inside `.git`). Fixes the bug where a fresh linked worktree saw the link but 0
  issues. Local trackers are unchanged (issues stay committed and branch-scoped). Resolved at
  runtime via `git rev-parse --git-common-dir`; no symlink. See
  `docs/DESIGN-storage-scope-and-evidence.md`.

## 0.21.7

Fixes the actual first-time experience for external users on LTS Node:

- **`engines.node` lowered `>=24` → `>=22.18.0`** (the real minimum — native `.mts` type stripping
  is on by default from Node 22.18 / 23.6 / 24). The `>=24` floor was wrong: 0.21.x runs fine on
  Node 22 LTS, but because npm does **engine-aware version selection**, every user on Node < 24 was
  silently served the year-old **0.10.0** (different presets, no `--version`, none of this work) with
  no error or warning. Now Node 22.18+ installs the current version.
- **Clear Node-version error** when the preset can't load: instead of the cryptic
  `Unknown file extension ".mts"`, ztrack now says it needs Node >= 22.18 and to upgrade — for
  anyone who lands on an unsupported Node (e.g. via a lockfile or `--engine-strict=false`).
- README/docs prerequisites corrected to Node ≥ 22.18.

(0.10.0 is deprecated on npm so the remaining fallback path on Node < 22.18 shows an upgrade hint.)

## 0.21.6

Final panel pass — came back clean except one real hint bug:

- The `issue_missing_assignee` fix hint suggested `ztrack issue edit <id> --assignee`, which is
  correct for a stored issue but fails on a loose file (`check ./file.md`) where the id isn't
  stored. The hint now also gives the loose-file fix (add an `Assignee: <you>` line to the body).

The panel otherwise found no defects: red→green works on both init modes, every resource `--help`
and `--version` are config-free and side-effect-free, bad verbs fail loudly, `issue delete` works,
no warning noise, the gate fails fabricated commits on loose files / stored issues / exported
roots, and the docs honestly disclose what is not verified (commit relevance, image existence).

## 0.21.5

Third panel pass — confirmed 0.21.4 and caught the rest of the `--help` inconsistency:

- **`--help` now works on every resource.** `lint --help` used to silently RUN lint (exit 0, no
  output); `fmt`/`tx`/`mcp --help` errored instead of helping. All now print usage and exit 0 with
  no side effects, like the rest. Regression test sweeps `--help` across all resources.
- **Quickstart no longer commits `node_modules`.** The README's `git add -A && git commit` step now
  writes `node_modules/` to `.gitignore` first, so a verbatim follower doesn't commit dependencies.

(A panel report of "`--help` is config-gated before init" was investigated and is FALSE — `init
--help` and all resource `--help` print correctly in a fresh repo; verified against the tarball.)

## 0.21.4

A re-run of the multi-perspective panel against 0.21.3 confirmed the earlier fixes and found a
few more CLI footguns:

- **`--help` no longer executes the command.** `ztrack init --help` used to *provision a tracker*
  and `ztrack loop start --help` used to *arm the loop*, because no resource-help case matched and
  they fell through. Both now print usage with no side effects (added `init` and `loop` help, plus
  a regression test asserting `init --help` creates no `.volter`).
- **`ztrack --version` works.** It used to return "unsupported command" / "no tracker config" with
  an inconsistent exit code; now `--version` / `-v` print `ztrack <version>` standalone, never
  touching config.
- **`--policy` is now in `sync github --help`** (it was documented in the README and accepted by
  the CLI, but invisible in help).
- **`issue delete`** is supported on the markdown backend — a fat-fingered issue can be removed
  (previously only `issue close --reason canceled` existed; deletion failed as "unsupported").
- **`issue create` output** terminates with a newline so the JSON and the `✓ created <id>`
  confirmation no longer run together on one line.
- README prerequisite notes *why* Node ≥ 24 (the `.mts` preset needs native type stripping).

## 0.21.3

Second pass on the multi-perspective onboarding review — the remaining friction the panel found:

- **No more `ExperimentalWarning: Type Stripping` on every command.** The installed `preset.mts`
  loads via Node type-stripping, which printed that experimental notice before every command's
  output and read like a fault. The CLI now drops exactly that one warning (every other warning,
  including other experimental ones, still passes through).
- **`--verify-commits` was a documented no-op.** Commit existence is verified by DEFAULT (it's the
  core guarantee); the flag did nothing and there was no way to turn verification OFF. Now
  `--no-verify-commits` is a real escape hatch for shallow/CI checkouts that lack the cited commits
  (and would otherwise fail closed); `--verify-commits` stays accepted as a no-op alias. Docs no
  longer teach the redundant flag.
- **`issue create` now confirms.** It still prints the new issue as JSON on stdout (pipeable), but
  adds a `✓ created <id>` line on stderr so a human can tell it worked instead of reading a wall of
  JSON as a possible error.
- **`loop start` stops overpromising.** Arming the loop wires no Stop hook by itself, so the message
  no longer claims the gate "now holds the turn" — it says it does so *once the ztrack-gate Stop
  hook is wired*.
- **Linked-sync model is documented in the README** (was CHANGELOG-only): GitHub is the source of
  truth and the local issue store is gitignored in linked mode; pull-then-push field-level
  reconcile; same-field collisions raise an unwaivable `sync_conflict` that gates `check`; and the
  `--policy merge|hub-wins|twin-wins` resolution lever.

## 0.21.2

New-user onboarding fixes surfaced by a multi-perspective review of the published npm artifact
(impatient first-runner, skeptical adopter, AI agent, GitHub-linked team):

- **Quickstart red→green actually works now.** The README's flagship example told you to "replace
  the fabricated SHA and re-run — it passes," but a fresh `git init` has no commit to cite and
  editing `body.md` doesn't touch the already-stored issue, so the headline demo dead-ended. It now
  shows the working sequence: commit, cite the real SHA, `ztrack issue edit --body-file` to
  re-import, re-check. Also fixed the example's issue id (`LOCAL-1`, the default team — was `ZT-1`).
- **Unknown verbs no longer exit 0.** A fat-fingered backend verb (e.g. `issue update`, whose verb
  is `edit`) printed `unsupported command` but exited 0 — a silent no-op a script or agent reads as
  success. A backend error (stderr, no stdout) now exits nonzero. Regression-guarded.
- **Linked init no longer lies about pulling.** When the initial GitHub pull is skipped (no auth),
  the next-steps no longer claim "your GitHub issues were just pulled in" — it now tells you to set
  up auth and run `ztrack sync github`.
- **Honest boundary documented.** The README now states plainly what the default preset does _not_
  verify: that the cited commit is *relevant* to the criterion (an unrelated real SHA passes) and
  that referenced image files exist on disk (structural strings unless your preset resolves them).

## 0.21.1

- **Universal fix-hint floor.** A finding the preset gives no specific hint for — an uncovered
  code, or any finding under a preset (spec/speckit) that does not implement `fixHint` — now still
  gets a located fallback from the core: `Fix <issue>: `ztrack issue view <issue>`, then fix … —
  or accept it: `ztrack waiver sign …``. Preset-specific hints still win; the floor only fills
  gaps, so EVERY finding is self-documenting regardless of preset.

## 0.21.0

- **Findings are now self-documenting.** Every `check`/`loop` finding carries a one-line
  remediation hint — the exact action that resolves it, located to the issue/AC:
  `↳ Fix: ztrack ac patch APP-1 dev/01 --json '{"evidence":[…]}'  (\`ztrack ac --help\` for the
  schema)`. Preset-owned via the new `Preset.fixHint` (the fix is the preset's mutation grammar);
  shown under each finding in the CLI and returned in the MCP `findings` so an agent acts directly
  instead of inferring the fix. The skill teaches the model, the finding gives the next command.
- **A `.claude/skills/ztrack` skill** packages the resolution model (the check/loop loop, the
  `ac patch`/`issue patch`/`waiver sign` verbs, honest-evidence rule) so a skill-aware agent is
  fluent before it hits a finding.
- Verified self-closing: a black-box test resolves a red AC *purely from the finding's fix hint*
  (no hard-coded `ac patch` knowledge) → green. The loop closes from the finding alone.

## 0.20.3

- **Fixed: a pulled issue's local edit didn't sync back to GitHub.** The one-way `pull()` (used by
  `ztrack init --sync` and `sync --pull`) didn't seed the reconcile base, so the first
  bidirectional `sync` after a pull saw a locally-developed issue as a both-sides change and
  refused to push it (a phantom conflict — `pushed: []`, GitHub kept the old body). `pull()` now
  seeds the base (a pull IS the common ancestor). Found by the full-scale LINKED development
  simulation (`simulateLinkedProject.ts`): 25 features synced to a real GitHub repo, each
  developed + pushed (GitHub reflects it) with the adversarial gate still catching every fake, and
  a convergent idempotent re-sync. The 7 prior GitHub e2es never hit it — it only shows when you
  develop a pulled issue at scale.

## 0.20.2

- **Fixed: the visualizer showed zero issues for every configured tracker.** Two latent
  regressions from the structured-metadata redesign — `configuredBoard` destructured the old
  `{ bundle }` from `loadValidationInput` (now `{ records }`) and, worse, didn't `await` the
  now-async `resolveTrackerValidation`, so `preset` was a Promise and `check` saw no `parse()`
  (`/api/board` returned `parse_failed` + an empty board). Caught by strengthening the e2es from
  liveness checks to real-data assertions: the visualizer test now hits `/api/board` and asserts
  the seeded issue is served, and the MCP test runs a real develop loop (check passes → an MCP
  write makes it fail → re-check catches it) instead of a single call.

## 0.20.0

- **The issue store is now committed for a local tracker** (and still ignored for a linked one).
  Testing the real dev workflows found `.volter/tracker/markdown/` was always gitignored, so a
  git **worktree, a fresh clone, and CI all saw an EMPTY tracker** — the per-worktree gate the
  Stop hook advertises was broken, and `ztrack check` in CI on a fresh clone was a silent
  false-green. Now `ztrack init` commits the store (clones/CI/worktrees verify the real issues),
  while `ztrack init --sync github` keeps it ignored (GitHub is the source of truth; `ztrack sync`
  repopulates the local cache). The sync runtime (`.volter/github/`, `.volter/sync/`) is always
  ignored. Verified: branch-scoped check/loop in a real git repo; a fresh clone of a local
  tracker sees + verifies the issues; a linked init still ignores the store.

## 0.19.2

- **Audited every taught command line + fixed stale help.** Running the whole taught surface
  caught: `ac --help` taught a removed DSL (`ac check|uncheck|set-status` — "unsupported
  command"; the real command is `ac patch`); `check --help` showed a short stale usage that
  **shadowed** the real target-grammar help; `issue --help` omitted `patch`; and docs taught bare
  `ztrack fmt` (it needs `--issue`/`--input`). All fixed. The cookbook e2e now exercises the full
  surface (issue list/view/patch, ac patch, export, lint, fmt, loop, waiver, completions, sync
  error, server-command recognition) and asserts the help matches reality, so it can't drift.

## 0.19.1

- **Cookbook-tested the documented recipes.** A new black-box cookbook e2e runs the README
  quick-start verbatim — and caught that "Two ways to start (A)" ended RED (it dropped
  `--assignee me` and reused the demo's fabricated-commit body, so `check` failed on
  `issue_missing_assignee`). Fixed the recipe to the verified-green flow (scaffold → create
  `--assignee me` → check). The cookbook keeps every documented command (check / check &lt;id&gt; /
  check ./file / loop gate / the fabricated-commit demo) honest in CI.

## 0.19.0

- **Onboarding reflects the actual scenarios.** `ztrack init` next-steps now adapt: a LOCAL
  init walks scaffold -> create -> check; a LINKED init (`--sync github --repo`) goes straight to
  check / loop / sync (your GitHub issues were already pulled), and both surface the check target
  formats (`<id>`, `./file.md`, in-a-worktree auto-scope) + the ralph loop. The README adds a
  "Two ways to start" block (local vs GitHub-linked) and shows `check`/`loop` as the daily verbs
  over one target grammar.

## 0.18.0

- **Conflicts render in the issue.** Alongside the gating `sync_conflict` finding, an unresolved
  conflict now writes a `## Conflicts` block into the issue body listing each field's local vs
  remote value — so the agent sees both values right where it edits. The block is LOCAL-ONLY:
  stripped from the body the sync reconciles/pushes (it never leaks to GitHub) and removed
  automatically once the conflict converges. Mirrors the core's `## Waivers` handling.

## 0.17.0

- **Unresolved sync conflicts gate `check`.** A same-field collision (under `merge`) is now
  recorded at `.volter/sync/conflicts.json` and `ztrack check` emits an unwaivable
  `sync_conflict` error while it stands — so the gate stays red and the ralph loop keeps going
  until it's resolved, instead of the conflict being a one-line warning you can walk past. This
  is a cross-cutting core concern (like waivers), not a preset rule. Resolving is a natural
  red→green step: pick a side and re-sync (`--policy hub-wins`/`twin-wins`, or edit + re-sync),
  which converges both sides and clears the record. Scoped checks (`--issues`, `--auto-scope`)
  only gate on their own issues' conflicts.

## 0.16.0

- **Configurable reconcile policy.** `config.sync.policy` (`merge` | `hub-wins` | `twin-wins`,
  default `merge`) chooses how a same-field collision resolves: `merge` surfaces it untouched,
  `hub-wins` takes GitHub, `twin-wins` takes the local tracker. Set it with
  `ztrack init --sync github --repo o/n --policy hub-wins`, or override per run with
  `ztrack sync github --policy <p>`. Non-overlapping field edits still always merge.

## 0.15.0

Two-way GitHub sync is now a three-way merge — a concurrent edit no longer silently clobbers.

- **`reconcileSync` (the default `ztrack sync github` + auto-sync).** Drives the twin's pure
  three-way `reconcile(base, fork, real)`: `base` = the last-synced common ancestor (now
  persisted by ztrack at `.volter/sync/github-base.json`, since the fork is the markdown
  tracker), `fork` = the tracker, `real` = a fresh incremental pull. Non-overlapping concurrent
  edits MERGE field-by-field (local edits the title while GitHub edits the body → both survive);
  only a same-field collision is surfaced as a **conflict** (default policy `merge`) and left
  untouched on both sides for a human to resolve, instead of one side winning silently.
- `ztrack sync github --pull` / `--push` stay one-way; the no-flag default is the reconcile.
- Verified with the real twin engine (cursor connector + egress) against a stateful fake GitHub:
  field-merge preserves both edits, a title/title collision surfaces as a conflict with neither
  clobbered, and a settled sync is idempotent.

## 0.14.0

GitHub pull is now a real cursor-based incremental read — and stops dropping closed issues.

- **Cursor connector.** The pull moves off the twin's snapshot fold (`syncGithubFromReal`) onto
  the kernel's `runConnectorPoll` over a new `githubIssueConnector` (`src/sync/github/connector.ts`).
  Each poll asks GitHub only for issues whose `updated_at` advanced past a persisted cursor
  (`GET /issues?since=<cursor>&state=all&sort=updated`, paginated), shadow-diffs them, and saves
  the cursor 1 ms behind the newest update under `.volter/github/cursors/<owner>-<repo>.json`.
- **Bug fixed: closed issues now sync.** The old path defaulted to `state:'open'` and a single
  un-paginated page of 30, so closed issues (and anything past 30) were silently dropped. The
  connector reads `state:'all'` with pagination. Verified live against real GitHub.
- The pull's `OBSERVED_AT` sentinel hack is gone — the connector gets idempotency from the
  shadow-diff on real `updated_at`, so re-observing unchanged content is a genuine no-op.
- This makes ztrack the first consumer of the twin's shared poll framework; the connector is
  written to lift into `@volter-ai-dev/twin-github` unchanged.

## 0.13.0

The two usage models — opportunistic `check` and the `loop` (ralph) — unified onto one target
grammar, plus a permanently-linked tracker mode.

- **One check/loop target grammar.** `ztrack check` and `ztrack loop start` now take the same
  target: `<issue-id>` (one issue), `<file.md>` (a loose file validated as one issue),
  `--issues a,b`, or nothing — which means the whole tracker, or, inside a worktree named for
  an issue, just that issue (auto-scope, opportunistic). `ztrack check ./body.md` brings back
  file-checking (removed in 0.11.0) as one format among several.
- **Footgun fixed.** A positional that is neither a known issue nor a file is now rejected
  instead of being silently dropped — `ztrack check ZT-9` on a missing id errors rather than
  printing a false green.
- **Loop drives the gate by target.** `ztrack loop start <id|file>` records the target; the
  Stop-hook gate (`ztrack check --auto-scope`) holds the turn on THAT target (precedence:
  `ZTRACK_ACTIVE_ISSUE` > the armed loop > the git branch/worktree).
- **Linked-tracker init.** `ztrack init --sync github --repo o/n` records a permanent link in
  `tracker-config.json` and pulls the repo's issues. Afterward `ztrack sync` needs no `--repo`,
  and user-facing `check`/`loop start` best-effort sync the tracker with it (pull the latest,
  push local changes) — the gate never does, so a ralph loop doesn't hammer the API.

## 0.12.0

Two-way GitHub issue sync, through the twin.

- **`ztrack sync github --repo <owner/name>`** — syncs tracker issues with GitHub
  issues in both directions (default pull-then-push; `--pull`/`--push` to limit). A
  synced issue *is* the GitHub issue (an identity binding, stored at
  `.volter/sync/github.json`, not a `linkedIssue` field). Fine local lifecycle states
  (draft/ready/in-progress/in-review) stay local; only title/body/done-ness round-trip.
- **Incremental + idempotent — never a full re-read/re-write.** PULL folds real GitHub
  into the twin (`syncGithubFromReal`, delta-only) and writes only the issues that
  actually changed; PUSH morphs the twin per changed issue and flushes through the twin's
  egress idempotency ledger (`pushPendingGithubActions`), so an unchanged issue is never
  re-PATCHed and a re-push replays zero API calls.
- **Auth is the gh CLI or `GITHUB_TOKEN`** — never a prompted PAT.
- **Standalone provider module** at `src/sync/github/` (transport, mapping, identity
  bindings, pull/push orchestration). ztrack keeps no universal sync engine: the twin is
  the shared event-sourced substrate, and each provider is self-contained (mirroring the
  standalone presets). Future providers get their own `src/sync/<provider>/`.

## 0.11.0

Standalone-preset rearchitecture. This release removes the universal/generic model
entirely: each preset is now a self-contained module, and grammar is owned by the preset
in both directions.

- **Three standalone presets — `default`, `spec`, `speckit`.** Each is its own module
  (`boilerplates/presets/<name>.ts`) with its OWN strict Zod schema, `parse`, `serialize`,
  and `rules`, importing only the mechanism from `ztrack/preset-kit`. The shared
  generic system is gone: no `genericSchema`/`genericParser`/`createGenericPreset`, no
  flag-toggled mega-preset, no "rule library". The only shared spine is the core engine
  (`CoreRoot` contract + rule evaluation). **Removed presets: `basic`, `simple-sdlc`,
  `simple-spec`.** `default` is installed when `--preset` is omitted.
- **Init-first onboarding** (reverses 0.10.0's zero-config direction): `ztrack init
  --team APP --preset default` → `ztrack issue scaffold` → `ztrack check`. Removed the
  zero-config `ztrack check <file.md>` file mode and the `ztrack example` command.
- **Bidirectional grammar.** Every owning preset defines `serialize` (the declared inverse
  of `parse`) on the `Preset` contract. `ztrack fmt` is now `serialize(parse(x))` through
  the active preset — there is no separate canonicalizer. A preset that adapts an external
  source-of-truth (`speckit` over Spec Kit files) is read-only and omits `serialize`.
- **Mutation is `parse → edit the typed model → serialize`.** The universal write-grammar
  (`mutate.ts`) and the structured-mutation DSL are removed — gone are `ztrack ac
  check/uncheck/set-status/block/unblock`, the `tracker_ac_*`/`tracker_evidence_add` MCP
  tools, and the `## Evidence`/`[En]`/`AC-Version` apparatus. They are replaced by one
  grammar-free primitive: `ztrack ac patch <issue> <acId> --json '{...}'` / `ztrack issue
  patch` and the MCP `tracker_patch` tool (the patch is the preset's schema shape; the
  preset re-serializes it). `ztrack evidence add` is now a content-addressed blob-put that
  returns a `sha256:` ref to cite in a patch; DSSE/in-toto attestation is unchanged.
- **Universal, eslint-style waivers.** A per-issue `## Waivers` section (core-parsed,
  preset-agnostic) managed by `ztrack waiver sign/clear/status`; a waived finding is
  downgraded to `acknowledged`, and a waiver that matches nothing emits `waiver_unused`.
  `ztrack export` now carries the waivers in `root.json`, so `ztrack check --input` honors
  them; `fmt`/patch preserve the `## Waivers` section across a model round-trip.
- **No `linkedIssue` in core.** A synced issue *is* the external issue (identity, not
  linking); the `linkedIssues` primitive was removed from the engine.
- **Removed the autonomy-profile subsystem** — `profiles/`, the `ztrack-setup` and
  `ztrack-profile-check` bins, `scripts/setup-ztrack-repo.mjs`, and the `core-sdlc`/
  `speckit` source-only agent-loop examples — all flag-preset-era legacy coupled to the
  deleted generic model.
- Installed preset is `.mts` (ESM, so it loads under Node type-stripping in CommonJS
  consumer repos). **Node floor raised to 24.**

## 0.10.0

- **`ztrack check <file.md>` — zero-config, eslint-style.** Point it at any issue-markdown
  file and it validates with the bundled `basic` preset: no `init`, no backend, no team
  key. Commit citations are verified against the current git repo, so the red→green moment
  works out of the box. The bundled preset is compiled in-process (no on-disk install). With
  no file argument, `check` still validates the live tracker project as before.
- **`ztrack example`** — writes a self-contained `example-issue.md` whose checked AC cites a
  *fabricated* commit, plus the one-liner to run it. `ztrack check example-issue.md` → red;
  replace the fake SHA with a real one → green. The 15-second first-run demo.
- **README quickstart rewritten value-first**: it now opens with the zero-config
  `example` → `check <file>` red→green, and demotes the `init`/team/backend flow to an
  "Adopt it into your repo" section. New `example` command added to help, completions, and
  the e2e gate.

## 0.9.0

- **The Python/SQLite `local` backend is removed.** ztrack is now pure JS end to end —
  the markdown backend (`.volter/tracker/markdown/*.md`) is the only store. Node + git is
  the entire toolchain; no `python3`, no native/Bun SQLite, so Yarn PnP and every package
  manager work with zero extra configuration. This deletes `backend/tracker-local.py`
  (~2,500 lines), `backends/local.ts`, the dead `markdownPort.ts` porter, and the unused
  `bun:sqlite` evidence-blob path (blobs are content-addressed files peer to the issues).
- **`ztrack migrate-local`** — a one-time migration for projects still on `backend:
  "local"`: it reads the old `tracker.sqlite` (a tiny stdlib `python3 -c` dump — needed
  only for this one read) and rewrites every issue as markdown, then flips the config to
  `markdown`. The original `tracker.sqlite` is left in place as a backup. A live client on
  a `local` config now errors with a pointer to this command instead of reading an empty
  store.
- The Python-only Linear-emulation verbs (`sprint`, `user`, `query`, `milestone`, …) that
  never had a markdown implementation are dropped from the CLI help surface.

## 0.8.0

- **The default backend is now pure-JS markdown** — `ztrack init` stores issues as plain
  `.volter/tracker/markdown/*.md` files. **No Python on the happy path:** `npm install
  ztrack` + Node + git is all a new project needs. The Python/SQLite `local` backend (adding
  full-text search) stays available via `backend: "local"`. Existing projects are unchanged
  (their config still names whatever backend they chose).
- Fixed three markdown-backend gaps that flipping the default surfaced (it had never been the
  default, and each gap silently produced a *passing* check on an empty/mis-typed issue):
  - `--body-file` is now read on create/edit (was silently dropping the body → no acceptance
    criteria → vacuous pass).
  - `--state open|closed|all` filter by status **type** (the recovery scripts use `list
    --state open`), not a literal state name.
  - `create`/`edit` derive `stateType` from the state name (`Done`→completed,
    `Canceled`→canceled), so done-gates and canceled-exemptions apply.
- CI now exercises the full surface under the markdown default (it would have caught the
  above), and the package-manager compatibility matrix tests it for real.

## 0.7.2

- **Fix: `ztrack/package.json` was not importable** — `require('ztrack/package.json')` (and
  `import`) threw `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED` because the `exports` map didn't list it.
  An `exports` field restricts subpath access to exactly what it lists, and tooling commonly
  reads a dependency's `package.json` (version checks, resolvers). Added
  `"./package.json": "./package.json"` (Node's recommended practice). Guarded in CI.

## 0.7.1

- **Fix: `ztrack check` failed on Node < 22.12 and under Yarn PnP** with `require() of ES
  Module … not supported`. ztrack is ESM (`"type": "module"`), and the installed
  `preset.cjs` does `require('ztrack/preset-kit')` — a `require()` of an ES module, which
  only Node ≥ 22.12 supports natively and Yarn PnP never does. ztrack promises Node ≥ 20, so
  this was broken on its own minimum. The `./preset-kit` export now has a `require` condition
  pointing at a self-contained CommonJS bundle (`dist/preset-kit.cjs`), so `require()` gets
  real CJS. Verified under pnpm, Yarn PnP, and with native `require(esm)` disabled (Node-20
  behavior); guarded in CI (`fresh-project-dry-run.sh` runs a check with
  `--no-experimental-require-module`).
- **Docs:** note that under Yarn PnP you should use `backend: "markdown"` (the default Python
  backend's helper script isn't reachable from inside PnP's zip store) or `nodeLinker:
  node-modules`.

## 0.7.0

- **New: `ztrack completions <bash|zsh>`** — prints a shell completion script for the CLI
  (top-level commands, subcommands, and the most-used flags). Tracker-independent. Install by
  sourcing the output: `source <(ztrack completions bash)` (or `zsh`). Listed in `ztrack
  help`; covered by real-CLI E2E in `demos/check-e2e.sh`.

## 0.6.1

Fixes from a multi-agent review of the loop / waiver / descope work:

- **Parser:** a `reason:` after `blocked-by:`/`blocks:` on an AC line corrupted the blocker
  — it parsed the dependency as a bogus issue and silently dropped the real one. The
  descope `reason:` keyword collided with the block-field parser; now terminated correctly.
- **Parser:** `descopeReason` was captured on ANY AC containing `reason:` and swallowed
  trailing `[E?]` / `commit:` tokens into the prose; now gated on `status: descoped` and
  bounded.
- **Done-gate:** a done case with EVERY acceptance criterion descoped passed with nothing
  verified — a free bypass cheaper than a waiver. The gate now also requires ≥1 actually
  passed AC.
- **Waiver scope:** a waiver downgraded structural invariants it has no business muting (a
  block cycle, a duplicate id, a self-block, a checkbox/status contradiction). Added a
  `waivable` flag (RuleRecord + Finding); those rules are non-waivable, so a waiver still
  covers readiness failures (missing evidence/commit) but a block cycle stays red.
- **Robustness:** the Stop hook guards a torn iteration-counter write (no `set -u` crash);
  `ztrack loop status` no longer crashes on a truncated breadcrumb; the armed-but-ztrack-
  missing block message now states how to get out.
- **gitignore:** repos `init`'d before the loop existed never received the `.ztrack-loop-*`
  ignore patterns (the block is written once). `ztrack loop start` and re-`init` now
  idempotently append any missing managed lines, so session/exempt files can't be committed.
- **Visualizer:** the "findings" view no longer drops issues whose findings are all
  `acknowledged`.

## 0.6.0

- **Loop escape hardening + state hygiene** (the `ztrack-gate` Stop hook + `ztrack loop`):
  - The per-session self-exempt path is now offered only once the agent is **past the
    half-way point of the iteration budget** (`n*2 > max`), so an early held turn reads as
    "keep working" and the hand-back surfaces only as a last resort — not a turn-1 quit
    button.
  - The **iteration cap holds-and-surfaces** instead of silently vanishing: on cap the loop
    disarms (the agent is never trapped) but drops a gitignored `.ztrack-loop-capped.json`
    breadcrumb, and `ztrack loop status` now reports `loop capped → <issue> after N
    iterations`; `ztrack loop start` clears it.
  - **State hygiene:** any disarm (green / cap / `ztrack loop stop`) now sweeps EVERY
    session's `.ztrack-loop-iter-*` and `.ztrack-loop-exempt-*` files, so no stale runtime
    state lingers in `.volter`.
- **Docs:** the `ztrack-gate` plugin README gains a "Trust boundary — cooperative, not a
  sandbox" section (the loop fixes premature-stop for a well-intentioned agent; it does NOT
  *contain* an agent that wants out — that's the harness's job; sanctioned exits are
  recorded, not silent), and notes descope counts toward "done" only on SDLC-gated presets
  (under `basic`, the waiver is the durable escape).
- **CI:** `demos/loop-gate-ci.sh` now also covers the above (R1/R2/R3, deterministic);
  `actions/setup-node` bumped off the deprecated Node 20 runner.

## 0.5.0

- **New: the ztrack loop — a ralph-pattern autonomy loop whose completion ORACLE is
  `ztrack check` (deterministic), not a trusted phrase or an LLM judging a transcript.**
  `ztrack loop start <issue>` arms a session-scoped Stop-hook gate (via the bundled
  `ztrack-gate` Claude Code plugin): while armed, the agent's turn can't end until that
  issue passes `ztrack check` (then the loop disarms itself), or the per-session iteration
  cap (`--max`, default 8) trips. NOT armed → turns end normally, so interactive use is
  never gated. `ztrack loop stop` / `status`. The gate scopes to the armed issue via
  `check --auto-scope` + `ZTRACK_ACTIVE_ISSUE`, so other red issues don't hold it.
- **New: three honest escapes from the loop**, graded by how durable they are — none fakes
  "done":
  - **Disarm** (`ztrack loop stop`): ends the loop for everyone; the issue stays red.
  - **Per-session self-exempt**: a blocked turn's message prints a session-keyed path
    (`.volter/.ztrack-loop-exempt-<session_id>`); creating that file lets *this* session's
    turn end. Keyed to the live session id and gitignored, so it can't leak to another
    session or outlive the one that made it.
  - **Durable waiver** (`ztrack waiver sign <issue> --reason "…"` / `clear` / `status`):
    records that the failing state is knowingly accepted; the issue's `error` findings
    become the new non-gating `acknowledged` severity so `check` passes. Sign-off is your
    **git identity**, captured automatically (the same identity that authors commits).
    Anchored to a fingerprint of the **acceptance criteria**, so it AUTO-STALES the instant
    those criteria change (an unrelated commit elsewhere does NOT invalidate it); an
    unreasoned waiver is itself an error.
- **New: descope as a first-class "satisfied-with-reason" AC state** (SDLC-gated presets).
  A done case whose AC is `status: descoped reason: …` is green WITHOUT a waiver — the
  honest home for "this criterion is out of scope". An unjustified descope is itself an
  error; `blocked` stays unsettled (a done case can't carry work that's still waiting).
- **New: `acknowledged` finding severity** — a downgraded `error` a fresh waiver has
  accepted: reported everywhere (CLI report, `--auto-scope` report, MCP, visualizer) but
  non-gating, like a warning. Only `error` gates `ok`. The visualizer renders the
  acknowledged count, a waiver banner (who signed it and why), and descoped ACs with their
  reason. (TS consumers that exhaustively switch on `Severity` should add the new arm.)
- CI now covers the Stop hook's full decision table and the `ztrack waiver` CLI round-trip
  deterministically (no live agent), on both the test and publish gates
  (`demos/loop-gate-ci.sh`). The live-agent end-to-end stays a manual demo
  (`demos/loop-e2e.sh`).

## 0.4.0

- **Breaking: validation rules are declarative records, not imperative functions.** A
  rule was `{ name, run: (input) => Finding[] }`; it is now a record
  `{ code, severity?, category?, depth?, phase?, select, when?, message }` evaluated over
  an engine-derived model. The engine derives an analyzed model once per check (per-item
  scopes `issues`/`acs`/`evidence`, id aggregates, and the unified block graph) and rules
  `select` facts off it; a preset's own cross-entity/graph analysis moves to
  `Preset.derive`. The schema carries SHAPE, the rules carry MEANING. **Migrate a custom
  preset** by turning each rule into `rule({ code, select: (m) => …, when, message })` and
  moving aggregate/graph computation into `derive`; a pushed
  `module.exports.rules.push({ name, run })` becomes `…push(rule({ code, select, when, message }))`.
  All four built-in presets (default, spec, generic, speckit) were migrated.
- **New: presets are INSTALLED as editable code, not referred to.** `ztrack init` now
  writes `.volter/tracker/validation/preset.cjs` as real plain-JS records that rent the
  engine + parser + schema from `ztrack/preset-kit` — not a `createGenericPreset({ flags })`
  shim. The rules live in your repo, editable in a PR. New `ztrack/preset-kit` authoring
  exports: `definePreset`, `rule`, `formatRef`, the fact types, and `genericParser` /
  `genericSchema` / `genericScaffold`. `createGenericPreset` stays as the typed reference
  the install vendors from; `presetInstall.test.ts` guards byte-identical behavior.
- **New: `ztrack preset upgrade`.** `init` records a pristine base
  (`.volter/tracker/validation/.preset.base.cjs`, commit it); upgrade 3-way merges new
  upstream rules into your edited preset (via `git merge-file`), preserving edits —
  overlaps become `<<<<<<<` conflict markers to resolve, then `ztrack check`.
- **New: `ztrack check --auto-scope`.** Validates the whole tracker (cross-issue rules
  stay correct) but exits nonzero only on the issue the current git checkout is for
  (resolved from the branch/worktree name); other issues are informational, and
  unresolved/ambiguous scope fails closed. Built for a per-worktree Stop-hook gate so N
  worktrees each scope themselves with no coordination.
- **Fix: the bundled Stop hook runs the locally-installed ztrack** (`node_modules/.bin/ztrack`,
  override `ZTRACK_BIN`), not `npx --yes ztrack` — so the engine running the check is the
  same one the installed preset imports (binary == library), and "done" only moves on a
  reviewed lockfile bump.

## 0.3.0

- **New: universal ids + unified blocking.** Every node has a derived colon-delimited
  universal id (`issue` / `issue:ac` / `issue:ac:evidence` / `issue:ac:proof`).
  Acceptance criteria declare `blocked-by:` / `blocks:` references whose target is
  another AC (bare `dev/02`, or qualified `APP-2:dev/01`) **or a whole issue**
  (`APP-4`) — so blocking crosses levels (AC↔AC, AC↔issue, issue↔issue). All
  directions and levels — including issue-level `relations` — fold into ONE derived
  dependency graph (`core/blocking.ts`), validated cross-tree: `ac_blocker_missing`,
  `ac_self_block`, `ac_block_cycle` (the graph must be acyclic, including cross-level
  deadlocks), and `ac_blocked_by_unpassed` (a done node can't depend on an unfinished
  one). The same graph powers a transitive blocked/actionable view (`blockStatuses`).
  Implemented by the installed presets and the default reference preset. Blocking is
  fully optional — a repo that never writes a `blocked-by:`/`blocks:` line is
  unaffected. Set it with a structured mutation (no hand-editing required):
  `ztrack ac block <issue> <acId> <refs…> [--blocks]` / `ztrack ac unblock …`, and the
  `tracker_ac_block` / `tracker_ac_unblock` MCP tools.
- **Hardening:** the repo-local validation entrypoint is confined to the project
  directory; the markdown backend rejects path-traversal issue ids; `ztrack check
  --input` reports malformed JSON cleanly; the visualizer binds to `127.0.0.1` and
  refuses to serve dotfiles / signing keys / the tracker DB; a missing `python3`
  yields an actionable message.
- **Breaking: removed the `ztrack/work-graph` export** and its `WorkGraph*` /
  `ProjectGraph` / `ValidatedPresetModel` types. It was a dead second/dual model
  (`{ graph, native }`) with no validation-pipeline consumer; the validated root
  is the single export every surface reads.
- **Evidence entries are now GFM list items** (`- [En] type: …` under `## Evidence`)
  so each entry is its own node and the parser discovers one record per node (no
  line-scanning). `ztrack evidence add` / `evidence ingest` write list items; a
  single legacy bare `[En]` paragraph is still read, but multi-entry bare-line
  blocks should be rewritten as list items.
- **Breaking: collapsed onto a single validation pipeline.** Validation now reads
  issues from the tracker and git/world facts into one typed, strict multi-issue
  root; pure deterministic rules validate that root, and the validated root is
  what `export` writes.
- **Breaking: `ztrack snapshot export` is replaced by `ztrack export`**, which
  writes the validated root (shape `{ "issues": [ ... ] }`). The committed CI
  artifact is now the validated root; recommended path `.volter/root.json`
  (previously `.volter/snapshot.json`). Validate it with
  `ztrack check --input .volter/root.json`.
- **Breaking: `ztrack check --json` output shape changed** to
  `{ ok, summary, findings }`, where `summary` is `{ issues, errors, warnings,
  status }`. `valid` is now `ok`; `summary.status` (pass/warn/fail) still exists.
- **Breaking: removed the public `checkTrackerSnapshot` / `exportTrackerSnapshot`
  / `TrackerSnapshot` API and the `./tracker-snapshot` package export.** Use
  `checkTracker` / `exportTrackerRoot` / `createGenericPreset` and the
  `ztrack/preset-kit` export instead.
- The installed validation preset is now `createGenericPreset({...})` from
  `ztrack/preset-kit`, living at `.volter/tracker/validation/preset.cjs`.

## 0.2.0

- Added the `ztrack visualizer` (alias `ztrack viz`) command: a standalone Bun
  web app that renders issues, acceptance-criteria progress, findings, and
  timestamps from the live tracker through the same core as `check`. Ships in the
  package as a self-contained bundle; the first run installs its client deps.

## 0.1.1

- Published the public `ztrack` package.
- Exposed the `ztrack` CLI through `npx ztrack`.
- Added the `basic`, `simple-sdlc`, `simple-spec`, and `speckit` install presets,
  each copied into the target repo as editable validation.
- Added CI coverage for typecheck and tests.
- Added the public README, security policy, contribution guide, issue templates,
  demo GIF, and root GitHub Action surface.

## 0.1.0

- First public package staging release.
