# Deterministic CI coverage for the ztrack loop — everything in demos/loop-e2e.sh that does
# NOT need a live agent. It drives the real Stop hook (plugins/ztrack-gate/hooks/stop-loop.sh)
# with crafted session_id payloads and asserts on its exit codes, and exercises the real
# `ztrack waiver` CLI round-trip (the eslint-`disable`-style per-finding waiver). No model
# calls, so it runs in CI. Uses the `default` preset.
