# ztrack-loop — Claude Code Stop hook implementing a ralph-pattern loop whose completion
# ORACLE is `ztrack check` (deterministic), not a trusted phrase.
#
# ARMED via `ztrack loop start <issue>`. While armed, the agent's turn can't end until the
# issue passes the check (then the loop disarms itself), or the per-session iteration cap
# trips. NOT armed → the turn ends normally, so interactive use is never gated. The issue
# is named at arm time, so there's no branch-naming requirement.
#
# Reads the Claude Code hook payload on stdin (uses session_id to scope the iteration
# counter). Exit 0 = allow the turn to end; exit 2 = block (stderr fed back to the agent).
